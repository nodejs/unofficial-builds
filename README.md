## About

The **unofficial-builds** project aims to provide Node.js binaries for some platforms not made available officially by the Node.js project at nodejs.org. Node.js is used on a large variety of platforms, but the Node.js project, in consultation with the [Node.js Build Working Group](https://github.com/nodejs/build), maintains a limited set of platforms that it tests code on and produces binaries for.

This list of officially supported platforms is available in the Node.js [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/BUILDING.md#platform-list), where you can also find details in the [official nodejs.org binaries](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/BUILDING.md#official-binary-platforms-and-toolchains) section. Some platforms are "supported" in that they are tested by the Node.js test infrastructure, but they don't have binaries produced for nodejs.org. Other platforms receive minimal or no official support.

**unofficial-builds** attempts to provide basic Node.js binaries for some platforms that either not supported or only partially supported by Node.js. This project **does not provide any guarantees** and its results are not rigorously tested. Builds made available at nodejs.org have very high quality standards for code quality, support on the relevant platforms and for timing and methods of delivery. Builds made available by unofficial-builds have minimal or no testing; the platforms may have no inclusion in the official Node.js test infrastructure. These builds are made available for the convenience of their user community but those communities are expected to assist in their maintenance.

## Builds

 * **linux-x64-debug**: Linux x64 `Debug` binaries compiled with `--gdb --debug --debug-node` enabled so that they include debug symbols to make native module, and core node, debugging easier. Tarballs replaces the Release `node` with a Debug built binary, in addition to all other standard files included in the official Node.js builds. Designed with Github workflow `actions/setup-node` in mind, so that it is easier to investigate CI segfaults. Is a direct swap for the regular binary and all node execution is the same as the Release build, except with debug symbols.
 * **linux-x64-musl**: Linux x64 binaries compiled against [musl libc](https://www.musl-libc.org/) version 1.1.20. Primarily useful for users of Alpine Linux 3.9 and later. Linux x64 with musl is considered "Experimental" by Node.js but the Node.js test infrastructure includes some Alpine test servers so support is generally good. These Node.js builds require the `libstdc++` package to be installed on Alpine Linux, which is not installed by default. You can add this by running `apk add libstdc++`.
 * **linux-x64-glibc-217**: Linux x64, compiled with glibc 2.17 to support [older Linux distros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glibc#Version_history), QNAP QTS 4.x and 5.x, and Synology DSM 7, and other environments where a newer glibc is unavailable.
 * **linux-x86**: Linux x86 (32-bit) binaries compiled against libc 2.17, similar to the way the official [linux-x64 binaries are produced](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/BUILDING.md#official-binary-platforms-and-toolchains). 32-bit Linux binaries were dropped for Node.js 10 and 32-bit support is now considered "Experimental".
 * **linux-armv6l**: Linux ARMv6 binaries, cross-compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 with a [custom GCC 6 toolchain](https://github.com/rvagg/rpi-newer-crosstools) (for Node.js versions earlier than 16) or Ubuntu 18.04 with a [custom GCC 8 toolchain](https://github.com/rvagg/rpi-newer-crosstools) (for Node.js 16 and later) in a similar manner to the official linux-armv7l binaries. Binaries are optimized for `armv6zk` which is suitable for Raspberry Pi devices (1, 1+ and Zero in particular). ARMv6 binaries were dropped from Node.js 12 and ARMv6 support is now considered "Experimental".
 * **riscv64**: Linux riscv64 (RISC-V), cross compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 with the toolchain which the Adoptium project uses (for  now...). Built with --openssl-no-asm (Should be with --with-intl=none but that gets overriden)
 * **loong64**: Linux loong64 (LoongArch64), cross compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 with the toolchain.

"Experimental" status for Node.js is defined as:
> Experimental: May not compile or test suite may not pass. The core team does not create releases for these platforms. Test failures on experimental platforms do not block releases. Contributions to improve support for these platforms are welcome.

Therefore, it is possible that unofficial-builds may occasionally fail to produce binaries and fixes to support these platforms may need to be contributed to Node.js.

## How

This project makes use of a server provided by the Node.js Build Working Group to compile and host binaries. Currently all binaries are produced on that server within specialized Docker containers. The possibility of future expansion to platforms that require alternative infrastructure to build is not excluded.

The server is configured according to the Ansible [unofficial-builds](https://github.com/nodejs/build/tree/main/ansible/roles/unofficial-builds) role in the [nodejs/build](https://github.com/nodejs/build) repository. This is executed via the [create-unofficial-builds.yml](https://github.com/nodejs/build/blob/main/ansible/playbooks/create-unofficial-builds.yml) playbook.

The build process operates as the `nodejs` user and in `/home/nodejs` which has the following layout:

 - `bin/` - currently only contains [`deploy-unofficial-builds.sh`](https://github.com/nodejs/build/tree/main/ansible/roles/unofficial-builds/files/deploy-unofficial-builds.sh) which is responsible for updating `unofficial-builds/` with this repository when it's updated (see below).
 - `download/` - the directory served at <https://unofficial-builds.nodejs.org/download/>
 - `logs/` - the directory served at <https://unofficial-builds.nodejs.org/logs/> and containing logs for deploys of this repository [github-webhook.log](http://unofficial-builds.nodejs.org/logs/github-webhook.log) and a directory for each build, identified by a datetime string combined with the Node.js version string of the compiled version. These log directories contain a primary `build.log` and a log file for each compile build "recipe" which is the output of the Docker container for that build.
 - `staging/` - a directory where build assets are placed by the Docker containers prior to promotion to `download/` along with a SHASUMS256.txt file and updated index.json and index.tab files.
 - `unofficial-builds/` - a clone of this repository, updated automatically when `main` is updated here.
 - `var/` - where state files are stored for the build queue, build locking and release checking.

The build process can be described as:

1. This repository is cloned onto the unofficial-builds server whenever it is updated (triggered via [github-webhook](https://github.com/rvagg/github-webhook)) and Docker images contained within the [`/recipes`](/recipes) directory are built by means of the [`/bin/deploy.sh`](/bin/deploy.sh) script which in turn calls the [`/bin/prepare-images.sh`](/bin/prepare-images.sh) script.
2. A periodic service runs every 5 minutes via systemd on the server which calls [`/bin/periodic.sh`](/bin/periodic.sh) script.
3. `periodic.sh` calls [`/bin/check-releases.sh`](/bin/check-releases.sh) for each release line being checked ("release", "rc", etc.). Any new versions that check-releases.sh finds are added to the build queue via [`/bin/queue-push.sh`](/bin/queue-push.sh) (the build queue uses a locking mechanism to prevent concurrent changes).
4. `periodic.sh` calls [`/bin/build-if-queued.sh`](/bin/build-if-queued.sh) which will execute a build if there is at least one build in the queue and no builds are currently running. [`/bin/queue-pop.sh`](/bin/queue-pop.sh) is used to atomically remove the next build from the queue. Note that only zero or one build per periodic run is executed. If the queue has more than one build, these will be deferred until later periodic runs.
5. When `build-if-queued.sh` encounters a build in the queue that it can execute, it calls [`/bin/build.sh`](/bin/build.sh) to perform the build. This script iterates through the images that have been pre-built from the [`/recipes`](/recipes) directory, starting with the [`/recipes/fetch-source`](/recipes/fetch-source) recipe that fetches the source file for the given version and validates official releases using GPG keys. Optionally, a recipe might have a `should-build` file which is used to determine if the recipe should run for a specific Node.js version. Each recipe is passed this source and is given a staging directory to place its binaries in. After all recipes are finished, builds are promoted to the <https://unofficial-builds.nodejs.org/download/> directory along with a SHASUMS256.txt file and the index.tab and index.json files for that release type are updated.

## How to add new target

1. Add target dir in recipe, and ensure that the necessary functions are implemented according to the above process description.
2. Add target to the recipes list in `bin/_config.sh`.
3. In order for the `index.dat` and `index.json` to index the new target, you will likely need to modify [nodejs-dist-indexer](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-dist-indexer/blob/main/transform-filename.js) so it understands the new filenames.
4. After a nodejs-dist-indexer release, the new version will need to be listed in `bin/_config.sh`.
5. Add or modify the README if necessary.

## Manual build triggers

Admins with access to the server can manually trigger a build using the [`/bin/queue-push.sh`](/bin/queue-push.sh) command. e.g.

```sh
su nodejs # perform the action as the "nodejs" user so as to retain proper queue permissions
cd ~
unofficial-builds/bin/queue-push.sh v16.4.0 # queue a new build for "v16.4.0" - the "v" is necessary
```

This places "v16.4.0" into `~/var/build_queue` which will be read on the next invocation of the build check timer. It may take up to 5 minutes for the build to start, at which point the log should be visible at <https://unofficial-builds.nodejs.org/logs/>.

The same process can be used to queue `rc` or `test` builds.

## Local use

This repository is primarily intended for use on the unofficial-builds server but it can be used locally for testing purposes. The `bin/local_build.sh` script is designed to mirror the server build process but with local trigger and for one specific recipe at a time.

### Setup for local builds

On deploy, this repository is placed within a the `unofficial-builds` home directory on the server, it is intended to operate from a subdirectory of where the assets are build, it's `$workdir` is the parent directory of wherever it is located. The `local_build.sh` script will create some directories within its `$workdir` so it's best to create a new directory for it to operate in. e.g.:

* `$workdir`
  * unofficial-builds/ *(this repository)*
  * staging/src/ *(source files for builds, made by `local_build.sh`)*
  * staging/`$disttype`/`$version`/ *(staging directory for builds, made by `local_build.sh`)*
  * .ccache/ *(ccache cache directory to speed up repeat builds, made by `local_build.sh`)*

e.g. clone this repository using the following commands to place it within an `unofficial-builds-home` directory:

```sh
mkdir unofficial-builds-home
cd unofficial-builds-home
git clone https://github.com/nodejs/unofficial-builds
```

However, you can override the default `$workdir` behaviour with a `-w <newdir>` argument to `local_build.sh` and direct it to a different directory where it can create its own subdirectories, so the above layout is not strictly necessary.

Please note that these scripts and recipes are intended to run in a Linux x64 environment, they may not work on other platforms, YMMV.

### Building

Once you have cloned this repository, you can build a specific recipe by running `bin/local_build.sh` with the recipe (an existing one or one you create within the `recipes/` subdirectory) name and the Node.js version you want to build. e.g.

```sh
bin/local_build.sh -r musl -v v21.0.0 # build musl binaries for Node.js v21.0.0
```

A successful build will place the source in `$workdir/staging/src/` and binaries in `$workdir/staging/release/v21.0.0/`.
